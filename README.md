Gestures in SwiftUI is an application built entirely in SwiftUI using the latest APIs to show possible usage of native gestures. 

I've built this app mostly for fun and to share gathered knowledge about SwiftUI and how to implement the most common gestures natively. 

Already implemented gestures:

1. Magnification gestures
2. Drag and drop gestures
3. Rotation gestures
4. General gestures
5. Combined gestures

Along with the gestures I've create an example of usint TipKit in SwiftUI and I am also showing how to do localization using the newest Apple approach. 

Feel free to ask for other gestures to be implemented later on or updated soon. 

Cheers, 
Theo
